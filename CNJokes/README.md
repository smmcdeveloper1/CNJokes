## Chuck Norris Jokes 

### Build and Running 
* Open the `.xcodeproj` file
* Run the application (`CMD + R`) on your chosen simluator 

### Design Patterns
* The application uses MVC (Stands for Model-View-Controller) pattern.

### Networking 
* 3rd party framework [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire). 
* * Using Alamofire should make developing networking layer easier and faster. 


### Tools
* [Swift Package Manager] (https://swift.org/package-manager/) was used to manage the 3rd party tools. 
* * The Advantage: automatically manage a dependency's dependencies. If a dependency relies on another dependency, Swift Package Manager will handle it for you. Anyone inside the project will easily know what dependencies your app is using.
